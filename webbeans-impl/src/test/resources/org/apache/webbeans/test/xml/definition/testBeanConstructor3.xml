      The constructor under test: public TstBeanConstructor(int ctParam, int multiplier)
      int ctParam value 42 and int multiplier value 100 will be injected into the constructor.
      Since these two values are primitives (int) their according wrapper classes have to be used (Integer).
      
      After bean creation, val2 will be injected via setter method.
