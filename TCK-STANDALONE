TCK Standalone Tests
----------------------------------------
Tests that are run outside of the any Java EE container. Those tests
are simple TestNG tests.

-----------------------------------------------------------------
Checkout RI TCK Suite from SVN and Generate TCK Coverage Report
-----------------------------------------------------------------
This coverage report identifies what each test is correspond to which part
of the JSR-299 Specification.

Checkout source code of the RI TCK from the location
- RI TCK Location : svn co http://anonsvn.jboss.org/repos/weld/cdi-tck/trunk/ cdi-tck
- Install it via "mvn clean install"
- Look at "cdi-tck/impl/target/coverage-cdi.html" document.

---------------------------------------
Running and Debugging in Eclipse IDE
---------------------------------------
To run and debug standalone tests in Eclipse environment, setup TestNG 
eclipse plugin. 

Plugin Location : http://testng.org/doc/eclipse.html

After setting up the plugin, you can run any TestNG test selecting project webbeans-tck
and specifying test class.

-------------------------------------------------------

- Change the following properties as
  - org.jboss.testharness.standalone=true
  - org.jboss.testharness.runIntegrationTests=false
